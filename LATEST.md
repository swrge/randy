1. **Organized Project Structure**:
   - Created a `features` directory for Discord command handlers
   - Created an `http` package for communicating with the bot-requester
   - Added helper functions in `helpers.go`
   - Updated the main function handling to delegate to appropriate feature handlers

2. **HTTP Client Wrapper**:
   - Created a wrapper in `http/client.go` for sending requests to bot-requester
   - Simplified the original complex code while maintaining key functionality
   - Added helper methods for common Discord API operations (sendMessage, editMessage, etc.)

3. **Modular Command Handling**:
   - Moved command handling logic to the `features` package
   - Made it easy to add new commands in separate files
   - Added a demonstration "weather" command to show how to extend functionality

4. **Utility Functions**:
   - Added helper functions for common tasks like responding to interactions
   - Organized code to avoid duplication and promote reuse

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created a detailed README.md explaining the project structure and how to extend it
   - Added inline comments to clarify important sections of code

## How to Add New Commands

Now, adding new commands is as simple as:

1. Create a new file in the `features` directory (or add to an existing one)
2. Implement your command handler function
3. Add the command case to the switch statement in `HandleSlash`

For example, to add a "remind" command, you would:

1. Create `features/remind_command.go` with your implementation
2. Add `case "remind": HandleRemindCommand(interaction, w)` to the switch in `slash_commands.go`
